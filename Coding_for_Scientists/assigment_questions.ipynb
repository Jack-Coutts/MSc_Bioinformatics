    "Write a function called ```distanceMatrix``` that takes as its argument two strings called ```inputfile``` and ```outputfile```, used to pass the names of the input and output file. The function should read from the input file a TSV table created as specified at the end of Question 3 (again, you do not necessarily have to answer Question 3 in order to do this; you can create a table with made-up data using an editor). Suppose data for N proteins are read. Your function should then create an output TSV file containing a matrix of size NxN (plus one row and one column for labels). The rows and columns of the matrix should correspond to individual protein file names, so that each matrix entry corresponds to a pair of proteins, say Pxxx and Pyyy. Such entry should contain the distance between the ```[polar, small, hydro]``` lists (considered as 3 dimensional vectors) corresponding to Pxxx and Pyyy. If done correctly, your matrix should be symmetric and have zeroes on the diagonal. Format the matrix with row and column labels as in the following 3-protein example (that contains random numbers and filenames):\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Filename      Pxxx.fas  Pyyy.fas  Pzzz.fas\n",

    "The exact alignment is not important, as long as the data are separated by tabs and the first line starts with a hash (```#```). Likewise, the order in which the proteins are listed is not important, provided the same order is used along the rows and along the columns. Do not add any quotes or other spurious characters. Your function should not return any value."
